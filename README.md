Recycling is pivotal in our battle against pollution and climate change. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, saves energy and conserves rare resources. Recycling a ton of paper can save **17 trees, 1400 liters of oil, 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space and 26500 liters of water**! That's enough to hydrate the inhabitants of a small village for an entire year!

### Creation Process

**Inspiration:**
We wanted to make something that will be useful to a lot of people. As pointed out above, recycling is very important for the health of this planet. Through this webapp, we hope that more people will realize its importance. Little steps go far!

**Building"**
We used a couple technologies that really enhanced our project. We used machine learning in order to identify the type of trash. That helped us a lot in accurately determining whether its recyclable or compostable. The Django web framework helped us create a streamlined website without too many pains.

**Challenges and what we learned:**
Communication and time management were one of the hardest aspects of this project. One of the major things we learned is that good planning can save a lot of time and headaches.

### The Future
Depending on the reception of our project, we might try to release it as an app on your phone! We will also make improvements to the accuracy of the machine learning model. Make sure to leave us a like if you want to support this project!
